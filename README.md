# Quantum-Exploration
Explore the shift from classical to quantum computing with this ESTIN Group 12 project. We cover qubits, superposition, entanglement, and key algorithms like Shor's and Grover's. Discover the history, math, and future applications of this revolutionary tech, from Feynman's theories to Google's Willow processor.
